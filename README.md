## Keyphy - System Access Control via External Device Authentication

Keyphy is a Linux CLI application that blocks access to applications, websites, and files/folders until authenticated with an external USB device. It uses the device's UUID and name to generate cryptographic keys for secure authentication.

## Features

- **Application Blocking**: Block specific applications at the system level using D-Bus monitoring
- **Website Blocking**: Block websites using iptables and hosts file modification  
- **File/Folder Blocking**: Block access to files and directories using permission changes and filesystem attributes
- **USB Device Authentication**: Use external USB devices as authentication keys
- **Cryptographic Security**: Generate secure keys from device UUID and name using PBKDF2
- **System-Level Enforcement**: Cannot be bypassed through normal user operations
- **Daemon Service**: Continuous monitoring and automatic blocking/unblocking
